# makepy

You ever find yourself doing the same things over and over?

That sort of things drives me nuts. To decrease the nuttage,
this is a simple script to help you with your Python scripts.


## Setup

This setup assumes you are on a Mac OS.

`TODO: add details for Linux and Windows`


 - Create a directory for this and other similar shortcut files, for example `cd ~; mkdir bin`
 - `cd` into your new directory and save the files from this repo into it
 - Open up the template .txt file and personalize it
 - Add the path to this directory to your `.bash_profile`, for instance: `export PATH=$PATH:~/bin`
 - save changes and close all files, and restart terminal
 - *From now on* simply enter `makepy.sh $filename.py` and replace ``$filename.py` with your actual file's name.
 - After running that last command, open up your new file and admire it proudly.
 - Count [how many hours of your life](https://xkcd.com/1205/) you've won back
 - Enjoy those extra hours, have a slice of pie
